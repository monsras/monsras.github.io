Stick close to the narrow strip of grass jutting out into the water to find an opening in the grass that you can slip through. Do so then head south until you reach the main land. Exit the water then head north and push the box out of the way to open up the shortcut to Kidoge Village. Next, head all the way south until you reach the dead end.

Head up the mountain using the coat from the Kangmi Fur side quest, the coat bought outright from Jafar in Rodia Town or just a bunch of healing items. After you head up a snowy slope and eventually cross a tree branch, you’ll come to a tower missing half a symbol.\n\nThe key you have on you will automatically be placed in the missing spot. Next, head down the tree to the right (east) of you to find the second tower with half a key.\n\nAs you approach it, the other key will automatically go into the slot and Encore will talk to you. Head through the archway behind the second tower to trigger a cutscene where you’ll enter the Owl Village. Once inside, use your horn on the guardian symbol on your left to unlock the fast travel point. Continue forward across the tree branch and head all the way up to the top, stopping in at the houses along the way to speak to the owls and gain new side quests!
