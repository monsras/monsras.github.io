Stick close to the narrow strip of grass jutting out into the water to find an opening in the grass that you can slip through. Do so then head south until you reach the main land. Exit the water then head north and push the box out of the way to open up the shortcut to Kidoge Village. Next, head all the way south until you reach the dead end. There will be greenery here that you can cut down with your sword to continue forward. Follow the path forward to reach Ridijo Canyon / Savoca Prison. Click here for a guide on Savoca Prison!
