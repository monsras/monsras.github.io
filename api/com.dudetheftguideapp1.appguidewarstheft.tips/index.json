You’ll need to find his sister Topa in Jacu Oasis. She’ll be dressed in red and her house is the tallest in Jacu Oasis with a big windmill on top. He suggests that the blacksmith might be able to help us turn the rod she’ll give us into a lever to replace the missing one. Furthermore, he’ll say that we need something to resist the incredible heat during the day but at night we should be prepared for the extreme cold. Since it’s still night in the game, you’ll need to prepare for the cold. As such a Kangmi Coat is in order. Click here for a guide on how to get one from the Kangmi Fur side quest! Once you’re prepared for the cold, travel to the Bobo Temple fast travel point then exit this area via the western map transition. Keep heading southeast, working your way through the map transitions, until you reach a place called Garduo Rocks. When you’re here, follow the path straight and cross the wooden bridge. Climb up to the tall rock immediately to the north of you to find a fast travel point. Make your way to the southeastern map transition. In the next area, you’ll again need to continue making your way to the southeastern map transition to trigger a cutscene for the Mauri Desert. Follow the dark path in the sand. You’ll pass a Minisio’s Map Shop along the way.\n\nBe sure to stop in and grab the map for the desert! Eventually, you’ll reach Jacu Oasis! Speak with Topa, who is wearing all red to receive the ancient rod and complete the quest. Before this rod can be used as a lever, it’ll need to be fixed by the blacksmith in Rodia.",
