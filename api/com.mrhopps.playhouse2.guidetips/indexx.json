Click here for a guide on how to receive the second Owl Village Key! Once you obtain the key, make your way to the northern part of Pansa Hills.\n\nYou’ll go past Ursula’s Mill and then will need to follow the signs for Camaro Woods. You’ll know you’re in the spot when you see a bunch of snow. Head up the mountain using the coat from the Kangmi Fur side quest, the coat bought outright from Jafar in Rodia Town or just a bunch of healing items. After you head up a snowy slope and eventually cross a tree branch, you’ll come to a tower missing half a symbol.\n\nThe key you have on you will automatically be placed in the missing spot. Next, head down the tree to the right (east) of you to find the second tower with half a key.\n\nAs you approach it, the other key will automatically go into the slot and Encore will talk to you. Head through the archway behind the second tower to trigger a cutscene where you’ll enter the Owl Village. Once inside, use your horn on the guardian symbol on your left to unlock the fast travel point. Continue forward across the tree branch and head all the way up to the top, stopping in at the houses along the way to speak to the owls and gain new side quests! Once at the top, a cutscene with Encore will trigger. You’ll receive an Owl Feather with instructions to give it to Maneko the Witch.",
